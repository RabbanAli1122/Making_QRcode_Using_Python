# Making QRCode Using Python

## Features:

This program has the following features:
1. This program can make a QRcode using Python and some libraries (i.e., qrcode and PIL).
2. Any scanner can scan the information encoded in the QRCode.
3. We can customize its pattern-color or background-color very easily with the help of a library called "PIL".

## A Simple QR Code Pattern & Working Mechanism:

1. To make a simple QR code, we just write three lines of code. In the first line, I imported the "qrcode" library. In the second line, I added a variable that will contain the link to which a person will be directed if he or she scans the QR code. In the third line, we will save our image, and that image will be stored with the location of the file in which the code is stored.

## An Advanced And Customized QR Code Pattern And Working Mechanism

1. To make a bit more advanced or customized version of QR Code with Python, we need another library along with the qrcode library (i.e., PIL library). And then all goes the same as the previous one, but this version is just a little bit of detailed in case of controling functions like changing the color of the pattern or background and increasing or decreasing the border of the box size.

## Requirements to run this code:

1. Anything that can run Python and some libraries (i.e., QRCode and PIL).
